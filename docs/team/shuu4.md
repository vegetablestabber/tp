### Project: ModMate

ModMate is a command-line tool that helps NUS students efficiently manage timetables and module information using the NUSMods API.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:  Added a `addmod` command that allows the user to add a mod to an timetable
  * What it does: allows the user to add single or multiple mods from NUSMods to an existing timetable based on the module codes or names.
  * Justification: Enables flexible timetable planning by letting users customise their schedules with specific modules they intend to take.
  * Highlights: Leverages modular data structures (Mod, CondensedMod) for efficient data handling and future scalability.

* **New Feature**:  Added a `removemod` command that allows the user to remove a mod from an timetable
  * What it does: Allows users to remove one or more modules from an existing timetable using their module codes or names.
  * Justification: Provides users with control over their timetable by allowing the removal of unwanted or mistakenly added modules.
  * Highlights: Ensures safe removal with checks for module existence.

* **New Feature**: Added `addbreak` command that allows the user to add a break to an timetable
  * What it does: Allows users to insert a labelled break period (e.g. Lunch, Study Time) into a specific timetable.
  * Justification: Improves usability and realism of the timetable by allowing users to block out non-academic periods for better time management and schedule planning.
  * Highlights: Enforces time format validation to avoid conflicts or input errors.
